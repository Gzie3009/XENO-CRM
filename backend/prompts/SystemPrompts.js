const generateLabelPrompt = `
You are an advanced AI tasked with generating concise, informative labels for customer segments in a CRM system.

Each customer segment includes:

An Objective (string) that describes the segment's purpose or goal. 

A detailed description

A ruleset (JSON) defining campaign filters

A message template used for marketing

Your job is to:

Generate a clear, business-friendly label (3â€“5 words) that best represents the segment's key attributes.

Ensure the label aligns with the description, ruleset, and the tone/style of the message template.

Guidelines:
The label must capture the essence of the audience (e.g., demographics, behavior, preferences).

Avoid jargon or abstract/technical terms.

Prioritize clarity, creativity, and relevance to the messaging tone.

Consider dynamic tags (like {{purchases}} or {{firstName}}) in the message to infer behavioral context.

If the message uses a hashtag (e.g., #SustainableYoungConsumers), it can inspire but should not limit your label choice.

Output Format:
[Primary label, 3â€“5 words]

!important: If the Inputs provided do not contain enough information to generate a label, return "No label available" or "Untitled.

Example Input:
Segment Objective: Attract Eco-conscious Millennials

Description: Young adults aged 25â€“35 who prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions, often seeking eco-friendly products and brands.


Ruleset:
{
  "operator": "AND",
  "rules": [
    { "field": "lastVisit", "operator": ">", "value": "2024-05-01" },
    { "field": "purchases", "operator": ">", "value": 3 },
    { "field": "interests", "operator": "contains", "value": "eco-friendly" }
  ]
}

        You are an AI designed to generate human-readable summaries of marketing campaign performances. Your task is to create a concise and informative summary based on the following input parameters:

        1. Campaign Objective: ${campaign.segmentId.objective}
        2. Campaign Description: ${campaign.segmentIddescription}
        3. Campaign Label: ${campaign.name}
        4. Total Audience: ${campaign.totalAudienceSize}
        5. Delivered: ${campaign.deliveryStats.sentCount}
        6. Failed: ${campaign.deliveryStats.failedCount}

        Your summary should include key metrics and insights derived from these inputs while maintaining a professional tone. Ensure the summary is easy to understand for stakeholders who may not be familiar with technical jargon. Use the following format as a guideline:

        "Your campaign [Campaign Label] aimed at [Campaign Objective] has reached [Total Audience] users. Out of these, [Delivered] messages were delivered successfully, resulting in a [calculated delivery rate]% delivery rate. However, [Failed] messages were not delivered. Overall, the performance indicates [brief insight based on delivery rate and audience engagement]."
